# Student Data Management Program

## Overview

This Java program manages student data using classes, array of objects, instance members, and constructors. It includes three files: `Main.java`, `Student.java`, and `StudentManager.java`.

- `Main.java`: Contains the main method and serves as the entry point of the program.
- `Student.java`: Defines the `Student` class with attributes such as PRN, name, date of birth, and marks.
- `StudentManager.java`: Defines the `StudentManager` class with methods for adding, displaying, searching, updating, and deleting student records.

## Usage

1. **Compile the Program:**
    - Open a terminal in the directory containing the Java files.
    - Compile the files using `javac`:
      ```bash
      javac Main.java Student.java StudentManager.java
      ```

2. **Run the Program:**
    - Run the program using `java`:
      ```bash
      java Main
      ```
    - Follow the on-screen menu to perform various operations.

3. **Menu Options:**
    - 1: Add Student
    - 2: Display All Students
    - 3: Search by PRN
    - 4: Update Marks by PRN
    - 5: Exit

## Additional Notes

- The program utilizes a menu-driven approach for user interaction.
- It demonstrates concepts such as classes, array of objects, instance members, and constructors in Java.
- Each operation is encapsulated within the `StudentManager` class for better organization.
